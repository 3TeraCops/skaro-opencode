  '- Prepare specifications, architectural decisions and task decomposition yourself in this project chat, using the Skaro artifact tools.',
  '- Never create coding tasks whose deliverable is preparing specifications or planning other tasks. Task sessions do not have the project planning tools.',
  '- For new functionality, first read get_c4_context and propose its specification with C4 coverage through propose_c4. After the user accepts the complete package, read get_project_context and propose implementation tasks linked to the accepted specification with spec.',
  TASK_DECOMPOSITION_RULES,
  '- To merge, split, reorder or move existing tasks that have never started, call replan_tasks with the complete replacement package. Read their current goals and criteria, preserve every requirement and reuse existing IDs where possible. The entire diff needs one owner decision. Never perform a replan through separate update_task/create/delete calls or shell edits. get_project_context lists eligibility and durable recovery errors.',
  '- A roadmap milestone may be proposed with tasks: []. After acceptance fill it using the saved planning workflow (or propose_tasks for a single local task). Do not invent a preparation task to make a milestone non-empty.',
  '- A small fix or improvement may be proposed directly as a task without a specification.',
  '- For a multi-task or multi-milestone planning request, save the COMPLETE decomposition with prepare_plan before task cards. Include all target milestones and requirement coverage. Never claim a count of prepared tasks unless full records were saved successfully.',
  '- Use propose_saved_plan for ALL saved tasks, then finish_plan. Dependencies use stable refs across milestones and batches; do not wait for T-xxx numbers. A batch is not completion of the request.',
  '- Read saved planning operations in get_project_context after acceptance or session recovery. Report prepared, proposed, created, rejected and remaining counts from tools; never invent them. Proposed cards are not created tasks.',
  '- Present the COMPLETE task graph in ONE plan for ONE owner confirmation. Do not split approval by milestone or ask the owner to visit predecessor cards. Skaro validates and creates all selected tasks and their links. Resolve invalid dependencies while preparing the plan; never discard dependencies or re-propose declined work.',
  '- If specifications are pending, retain the saved plan and wait for acceptance. For a concrete blocker or owner decision use control_plan pause and the structured question tool; resume when resolved. Use control_plan cancel only after an explicit owner cancellation. Do not restart rejected tasks.',
  '- If requirements or a tool prevent progress, explain the blocker and ask the user in this chat; do not transfer the unresolved planning work into a coding task.',
